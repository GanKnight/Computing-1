  Title : Teacher
  Mdm Sim, Mdm Sim, how are you doing?
  We hope that you are flowing!
  Your great lessons are just
  With me on the cusp
  Leaving others with a gasp.
  Co-form teacher acting like a form,
  leaving our class with a forme.
  Chinese, Citizenship and Character Education to help us,
  All of these are done by you to help us not fuss.
  Calling us some by Chinese or English,
  Teaching us how to make a good dish,
  With names and terms on the plate,
  Putting nothing else to rebate.
  Hands always on your face,
  No wonder you've got a great pace.
